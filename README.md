# LibreTime

LibreTime is a community managed fork of the AirTime project.

It is managed by a friendly inclusive community of stations 
from around the globe that use, document and improve LibreTime. 
Join us in fixing bugs and in defining how we manage the 
codebase going forward.

We are currently ramping up development on this repository.
