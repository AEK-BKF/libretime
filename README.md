# LibreTime

LibreTime is a community managed fork of the AirTime project.

It is managed by a friendly inclusive community of stations 
from around the globe that use, document and improve LibreTime. 
Join us in fixing bugs and in defining how we manage the 
codebase going forward.

We are currently ramping up development on this repository.

## Releasing

The LibreTime maintainers release new versions of LibreTime at regular
intervals. We follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
standards.

In a nutshell, given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH we increment the:

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Given the history of the project we will be starting with version 3.0.0.

Stay tuned for early alphas and lots of betas as we get development
up and running.
