The first entry on Airtime's **Help** menu is for the **Help Center**, which is the official support channel for Airtime Pro. The next link offers a quick **Getting Started** guide for new users. There is also a link to the online version of this **User Manual** and an **About** page, which displays version and licensing information.

The Live Chat window for support is in the lower right corner of the page.

When all other avenues have been exhausted, email us directly at <contact@sourcefabric.org> and we'll try to help!
