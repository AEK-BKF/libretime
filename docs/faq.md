**What is LibreTime?**

LibreTime is a community managed fork of the AirTime project.

It is managed by a friendly inclusive community of stations 
from around the globe that use, document and improve LibreTime. 

**Can I upgrade to LibreTime?**

In theory you can update any pre 3.0 version of AirTime to
LibreTime 3.0.0 and above. More information on [Upgrading](../manual/upgrading)
is in the docs.

LibreTime is complex software, as such it is close to impossible
to guarantee that every upgrade path works as intended. This
means you should trial the update on a parallel test 
infrastructure to minimize possible downtime.

Please let the community know if you encounter issues with the
update process. 

**Why did you fork AirTime?**
