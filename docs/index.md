Welcome to LibreTime
====================

LibreTime makes it easy to run your own online radio station. Check out some [features](features.md) and [screenshots](features.md#screenshots), then [install it](install.md) and start broadcasting!

LibreTime is Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). Among other things, this means that you have the freedom to:

* Run it royalty-free for as long as you like.
* Read and alter the code that makes it work (or hire someone to do this for you!)
* Contribute documentation, bug-fixes, etc. so that everyone in the community benefits.

LibreTime is a fork of AirTime due to stalled development of the FLOSS version. For background on this, see this [open letter to the Airtime community](https://gist.github.com/hairmare/8c03b69c9accc90cfe31fd7e77c3b07d).
